                Established miles away from home, PISJ-ES embodies the spirit of home in its true sense. 
                The institution, a world in itself, is geared to provide education of the highest level. 
                The citadel of learning commits to enhance the educational experience and bring up intellectuals 
                through all-round and interactive studies while maintaining a standard of competence par excellence.
                PISJ-ES has undoubtedly proved itself worthy of its name, holding the flag of Pakistan high. 
                We aim to provide an environment that generates patriotism and strengthens belief in Islamic values 
                while giving each student equal opportunities to develop knowledge, skills and abilities to their
                potential. We place high premium on the inculcation of spiritual, human and patriotic values at 
                every level. Our vision is to see our students of today as ideal citizens and future architects of 
                Pakistan.
