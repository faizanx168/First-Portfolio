    <p class="wrap">Instating new horizons, promising opportunities, substantial prospects and bright future are what PISJ-ES is all about. In this institute, every day dawns with the new challenges and a wide range of activities which thrive to meet single objective of achieving the highest standard of education. Each member of the team endeavors continuously to ensure an atmosphere of excellence, novelty, innovation and incessant learning to nurture the talents of our students at all levels.

    Alongside, we are committed to inculcate in our students the ability to tolerate and to distinguish virtues from vices to develop soft skills and groom them to become dynamic and responsible citizens to encounter every kind of situation wisely and perceptively.
    Over the past two decades, our school has expanded to a greater degree. With 4000 students and the faculty strength touching nearly 600, we are determined to harmonize the equal opportunities in academics, sports and extra-curricular activities.
    
    We have a team of dedicated and professionally motivated educators as head of departments to make the learning experience more meaningful and colossal. Our exceptionally passionate and highly qualified faculty members encourage students to love learning, practice novelty, take risks and accept challenges. They strongly believe in the significance of collaboration and welcome the opportunity to work with all members involved in the lives of their students.
    
    Keeping up the motto of ‘pride of the nation’ and to retain our eccentric individuality in a far-off country, makes this school prominent to emerge as the icon of excellence in education in the MENA region.</p>
