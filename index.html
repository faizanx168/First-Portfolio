        <p>          I am Muhammad Faizan Abbasi,  a student of Programming and Software development at LaGuardia Community College. I was born and raised in Pakistan, I started my schooling in Iran and graduated middle school in Tehran. I have done my O/A-levels from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. After a few years, I moved to New York in 2020 and started my college journey at LaGuardia Community College. New York City has thought me how to be strong and independent and how to become successful in life. Apart from being a college student, in these two years, I have worked as an auto electrician and worked as a team member at target. I am also part of the research program at the CUNY Research Scholar Program and I am doing research in Outlier detection and removal in Wireless Sensor Networks.
          I was recently employed at LaGuardia college as a Student Success Mentor where we focus on developing a student-mentor relationship to help fresh year students better understand themselves and become successful in their college journey. In the future, I am planning to complete my Associate degree this year and transfer to a four-year college where I can complete my bachelors in software engineering. Right now I am learning many new technologies such as Front-End Web development, ML, python, and C++. I will be focusing on becoming a web developer and getting a job in the coming year and starting my career in tech. </p>
